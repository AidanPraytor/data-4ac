    "In data science, we utilize large and diverse datasets to make conclusions and predictions about the world we live in. Doing so involves a process called the data science lifecycle, which is a high-level description of the stages of work that data scientists perform as they work on a data science project. There are a number of data science lifecycles that people have developed and use to learn and practice data science. The lifecycle that we will be working with in DATA-4AC is a newly updated lifecycle that considers the human contexts and ethics of data at every stage. \n",

    "This process is often iterated as new questions and problems emerge after the last step that enable data practitioners  to learn more about the characteristics and patterns of the world, which in turn informs the kinds of questions that are asked.\n",

    "In this notebook, we'll focus on stages 2 and 3. We'll first introduce the data sets used in this notebook and then take a deeper look into the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA). We perform EDA to uncover any patterns or features from the data and better understand the underlying structure. EDA can involve looking for outliers or anomalies, identifying important variables, and data visualization. "
