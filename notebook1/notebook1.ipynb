    "The abrupt relocation of countless Japanese Americans during World War II resulted in a lasting change in the location of many of these Japanese American families even after the war ended. During the relocation process many families were forced to quickly sell their possessions, businesses and land holdings. Those who did not, often came back to find their possessions gone and homes vandalized. As a result, many internees that lived on the West Coast of the United States did not return to their previous homes after the war.\n",

A disadvantage of the first map is that the circles begin to overlap and cloud the overall view of the map. An advantage of the first map is that it is very easy to tell where large populations lie on the map. A disadvantage of the second map is that one must consult the legend to understand what the map is displaying. An advantage of the second map is that each marker is clearly visible and they do not overlap.*"
