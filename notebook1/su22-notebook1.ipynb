    "### A Brief History\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an _interactive computational environment_ that supports over **40** different programming languages, but was first released as a web-based interface for IPython in 2011. [Fernando Perez](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-p%C3%A9rez), a professor in the Statistics department here at UC Berkeley, created [IPython](https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/ipython) as a graduate student in 2001 and co-founded [Project Jupyter](https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/project-jupyter) in 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are `Julia`, `Python` and `R` (`\"ju\"` from `\"Julia\"`, `\"pyt\"` from `\"Python\"`, and `\"er\"` from `\"R\"`; all together you get `\"ju\" + \"pyt\" + \"er\" = \"jupyter\"`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The word notebook is an homage to Galileo's notebooks in which he documents his discovery of the the moons of Jupiter (the planet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the Jupyter Notebook interface has been around only about a decade, the first notebook interface, [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/), was released over 30 years ago in 1988. Other notebook interfaces have been released since then, but none have gained as much traction as Jupyter Notebooks have. Starting in the early 2000s, open-source scientific tools were becoming more and more popular and with the widespread popularity of Jupyter, it's well on its way to becoming a standard for sharing research methodology and results.\n",

    "### Why (Jupyter) Notebooks?\n",
    "Notebooks are used for [*literate programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), a programming paradigm introduced by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) in 1984, in which a programming language is accompanied with a documentation language, or a natural language. In other words, the computer program has an explanation in a natural language. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to programming effectively treats software as works of literature ([Knuth](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf), \"Literate Programming\"). _It supports people to have a strong conceptual map of what is happening in the code and also to have clarity on the flow and logic of the code/program, which is helpful for both the writer and the reader_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter leverages this idea and enables users to create and share documents that combine code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and rich media. Notebooks are multipurpose and can be used in any discipline. The notebook is like a laboratory notebook, but for computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers can write code to work with their data while supplementing their methods with explanations, analysis, or hypotheses. Notebooks are also used in education because they enable students to engage with content presented in different forms, experience computation with no prior experience, and practice programming in a scaffolded way. \n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "    <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "In our class, we'll be using Jupyter Notebooks to introduce you to how data scientists work with data, to learn about issues of justice using real-world data sets, and to also learn how to reason about the human choices embedded in the practice of data science and their significance.\n",

    "### Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cell Types\n",
    "A notebook is composed of rectangular sections called **cells**. There are 2 kinds of cells: markdown and code. \n",
    "- A **markdown cell**, such as this one, contains text. \n",
    "- A **code cell** contains code in Python, a programming language that we will be using with all of our data science modules in this class. You can select any cell by clicking it once.\n",
    "    - Code cells can also contain code in other languages like Julia, or R: both of which can also be used in data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Cells\n",
    "To \"run\" a code cell (i.e. tell the computer to perform the programmed instructions in the cell), select it and then,\n",
    "- Press `Shift` + `Enter` to run the cell and move to the following cell\n",
    "- Press `Command/Control` + `Enter` to run the cell but stay on the same cell\n",
    "    - This can be used repeatedley to re-run the same process\n",
    "- Click the Run button in the toolbar at the top of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results and Outputs of a Cell\n",
    "When you run a code cell, a number of things can happen, depending on the type and contents of the cell:\n",
    "1. If the cell is a markdown cell, the text will be rendered according to the structure (_Markdown_, _HTML_, etc.)\n",
    "2. If the cell is a code cell, the result of the last line in the cell will be shown\n",
    "    - This output may be text, a number, a picture, or a visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "If a code cell is running, you will see an asterisk (\\*) appear in the square brackets to the left of the cell. Once the cell has finished running, a number will replace the asterisk and any output from the code will appear under the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it! **Run the cell below to see the output.** Feel free to play around with the code -- try changing 'World' to your name."

    "## Notebooks in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "With proprietary software like Mathematica, users are supposed to trust the results returned and are unable to check the code. In contrast, Jupyter fosters transparency and hence encourages reproducibility, which refers to the ability to reproduce the results of a scientific study. Not only is the code behind the software available for anyone to inspect or tinker with, but code in the notebooks can also be examined or re-run to reproduce the results. Theodore Gray, the co-founder of Wolfram Research who was also involved in creating the Mathematica interface, said about Jupyter, \"I think what they have is acceptance from the scientific community as a tool that is considered to be universal.\" In other words, Jupyter Notebooks support the computational work of researchers from different fields, from astronomy to psychology to literature, and therefore enable new ways for researchers in very different domains to share research tools, methods, and learn from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The versatility of the  Notebook also has important consequences for data science and the workflows that are involved when working with data in settings other than research, such as for education and community science projects. The process of working with data can be messy and nonlinear, which a Jupyter notebook can handle well because of its flexibility (though this messiness is often reflected in the resulting notebook!). The power of the notebook lies in its ability to include a variety of media with the computation as a means to maintain accountability, integrity, and transparency for both the author of the notebook and the audiences that you share your work with. In a  world in which algorithms and data analysis inform many aspects of life and where computation is getting more and more abstract, the ability to understand and reason about computational work is more important than ever."
